Industrialism will ensure our economy will keep up with the rest of Europe and America, as more and more nations industrialize.

Of the many options a few have been the most promising.\n\nPrincess Beatriz of Spain, daughter of the exiled and recently deceased king of Spain Alfonso XIII, is the most obvious choice. She is popular in Spain, enough to restore a constitutional monarchy if we were to marry her. Additionally she is connected to Austrian blood via her grandmother and is currently residing in Hôtel Meurice, close enough to easily plan the wedding ceremony. The marriage with her, would restore the Habsburgs claim over the Spanish Crown.\n\nAnother voice is the also exiled Princess Elizabeth of House Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Although very much younger than [CZE.GetLeader] her connection to the British throne is powerful, once the communists have been dealt with. Currently residing under the care of the French, we shall be formally invited to the faction, once the wedding has been concluded.\n\nJust as German aristocracy has always been in the mix, this time the House of Hohenzollern, the once Kings of Prussia. Although not really in positions of power, they are still known as little more than national trophies. Princess Alexandrine of Prussia is still unmarried, second-to-last daughter of Wilhelm IV. Being married to her would really ease tensions with Germany, allowing us to join their alliance, in exchange for keeping monarchist sentiments low in Germany.\n\nThe odd choice in the mix is Princess Maria, daughter of the recently deceased Prince-Regent Manuel, a women cursed with deafness, she was handpicked by [CZE.GetLeader] to get into the selection, as he has met her quite often before. They seem to have an mutual understanding and even not so secret love affair.

Due to our expulsion of communists many countries boycotted the Exhibition, leaving most stalls empty. Even with this sorry look, the exhibition was a rousing success. Millions visited the Palace and surrounding park, leaving with many impressions of telescopes, revolvers, steam-machines & carbonated soda.

What makes this outbreak even more insidious is, that there isn't even a plausible theory on how the fever is spreading, seemingly even reaching quarantined & isolated houses across the city.\n\nThe second highly public outbreak is the Great Parrot Fever of Birmingham. A relatively new illness, probably being brought to Britain from South America or Western Africa, this illness is spreading by Love Birds and other small parrots.

 mod_calais_struggles.2.d:0 "As France marched from Tobruk to El Alamein and started the French-Ottoman War, Calais was on fire. Belgians, Communists and Arab immigrants filled the streets and barricades burned. Known later as the Battle of Lille, opposition in Calais was the highest across France, helped by British and Belgian agitation. As the French army was busy fighting in Africa and Asia Minor, the French police seemed unable to curtail the riots, basically deciding to pull out of the region and laying down siege. At this point, international pressure, both from the US and Germany was put on France to either quell the rebellion or to give in demands and end the war in Egypt. France choose neither, continuing the siege. Secret back channel talks resulted in the Reinsurance Treaty of Engelberg, basically giving Britain a free pass for intervention in Calais and the surrounding area, with Germany and the US backing them. In a quick 4-days campaign, Britain marched from Belgium into the region and occupied the cities, basically stopping where the siege was constructed. The protest from France was considerable, but the war was too distracting and costly to open a second front.\n\nMany French communists expected either a liberation by the British or to be given their own government in the wake of the invasion. Neither happened and Britain continued the occupation, implementing only minor collectivization efforts, quickly losing the favour of the people. After the end of the French-Ottoman War, France demanded the return of its territory, but Britain refused, citing security concerns and public support as reasons for doing so. Britain was supported in this by Germany, leading to the German-French split, having lukewarm relations before. Since then the occupation has expanded and the favour from the public has basically ceased to exist. Since then 'The Struggles' emerged, a violent guerrilla campaign to unify the country back with France.

Hundreds of fighters entered the city in the morning and occupied the post office, telegram office and town hall. A loose perimeter was set up and all movement in or out was controlled. This can't stand.\n\nThe 37th Infantry Brigade of the 12th Division was quietly moved to the outskirts of the city. Laying in the field, waiting to attack. The CR, seemingly happy with their victory, celebrated, loudly drinking and generally having a good time. Major-General Roderic Petre waited till the last songs played from the record players and ordered his men to attack. At first quietly, but as the first sentry units were awoken by the motors of the armoured cars, the charge began. Air support was called and a combined-warfare advance began. The checkpoints were quickly overrun and the soldiers pushed inside the city. There many guerrillas were still drunk, but able to fight back, resulting in a drawn-out street battle, with many casualties on both sides. Petre purposely left the street to the East open for the CR-soldiers to escape, avoiding a last-stand scenario. The city was won back in the evening, after two days of occupation.\n\nThe Battle is notable for two reasons. Firstly it was the first use of British bombers in the region, providing air support and bombing two trucks with reinforcements. Secondly it was the first battle where two armored cars fought against each other in the town square. The French stole theirs from the local police barracks and pushed it into service. Both cars were damaged, but remained in use."

Even before being able to evaluate the situation, a machine gun opened fire from the woods, apparently hitting the engine and the left wing, making it uncontrollable and crashing in a sizable fireball.\n\nThis turn of events required another plane to get involved, but this time the much more modern monoplane Hawker Hurricane, flying in from Lille. The pilot managed to strafe the attackers, forcing them to retreat. In the confusing retreat a single salvo of machine gun fire was sprayed in the air, hitting the cockpit, badly injuring the pilot.

Whilst patrolling the old fort in the old town, two soldiers were stopping at the Place Charles Valentin, the town square, discussing the towns history and importance for the British navy and independence. Picking up on the independence talks, a small mob formed by the clock-tower and refused to disperse. The crowd began shouting, gathering more people and throwing rotten vegetables from the days-earlier market. Fearing to be cut of from escape, the patrol demanded dispersement, aiming their weapons onto the crowd. The sergeant commanding the unit insists that shots were fired at that moment, prompting his men to open fire as-well, whilst making their retreat along the Northern path.\n\nIn the following days, reports from the Police, the local People's Patrol and other British units, put the death toll at two, with another two having sustained life-threatening, but not fatal injuries."

Apparently this was unacceptable for a small detachment of the 1st Parachute Regiment, who apparently got drunk the night before and in the morning hours marched onto the town square, broke down the doors of Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille, the municipal arts museum, marched to the balconies and ripped down all the fleur-de-lys flags hanging along the balustrade. In return the British Union flag was hung, but only two were brought.\n\nAs the rest of the unit appeared on the scene, along with hundreds of angry citizens, the occupiers walked out of the museum, flags in hand, throwing them in the drained fountain and setting them on fire. The rest of the unit was put on crowd control, but didn't stop their comrades from burning. The still buzzed paratroopers shouted 'Death to all Kings', 'Viva la Revolution' and 'Burn the Lille'. The last one especially, left a sour taste in the crowd's mouth, hastening the retreat of the unit.\n\nAccording to a source inside the CR, the guerrillas hastened to replace the burned flags, being celebrated as they climbed the museum.\n\nThe drunk soldiers will of course be put on trial, but it seems the unit as a whole has problems worth discussing."

But it seems the 1st Parachute Regiment has pulled it off again.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion of the Unit was preparing a weapons sweep along the canton, wherein Agincourt is located. Two trucks drove into town and demanded the people to gather near the church and were asked to disarm and point the soldiers to a suspected weapons cache thought to be located between Agincourt and Tramecourt. While the officers were talking with the mayor and priest, the surrounding soldiers began to mock the French people gathered along the church, giving them the finger, referencing the myth of the French threat to the English Longbowmen to cut them off. As this was going on, a young private spotted a rifle being aimed at the officers head from within the crowd and without warning fired his gun into the crowd, killed two on the spot. His fellow soldiers did so in turn, also opening fire, without any return fire from the villagers. The officers tried to maintain control, but the mission was out of control, with bullets being fired randomly into houses and the church. Within minutes 15 people laid dead, with the last being the local priest, rushing to the aid of a farmer, being hit in the stomach, being mistaken for grabbing a pistole, even while waving a white flag.\n\nThe massacre was stopped when other squadrons from the same battalion arrived on the scene and detained the troops. In total, nearly 15% of the village was dead or injured. The squadron will be punished, but not in France to guarantee an unbiased trial, even with the protests from the French."

After the night in the town, one soldier neither was found in the farm house he was spending the night, nor somewhere else in the town. The sergeant of this unit was prepared to occupy the town, till the soldier was found, but was stopped by a People's Patrol messenger arriving on his bike. He told the officer about an incident in the church of the village of Anvin, about 18km away.\n\nIt seems that the missing soldier wandered into the village at sometime in the night and broke into the priests house, capturing him and putting him in the church. After the first reports there they played Cossack roulette, the theory supported by the revolver with 5 spend casings being found. The strangest thing seems to be, why both people were found dead, both with the same head wound. Multiple questions appeared in the local gossip and newspaper, such as, why did the soldier walk all this way? Why didn't anybody hear the commotion or gunshots? The preliminary investigation found not even a trace of connections between the private and the priest. The mystery seems unlikely to be solved anytime soon."

While technically not illegal and within their rights to secure the highly important harbour of Calais, this action is seen at as unacceptable by the French population.

This soon overwhelmed the police and the called militia, when stone began to be thrown. It seemed like the people might soon be able to threaten the British military installation in the city. This resulted in the Parachute Regiment being called in and them first sending in the 2nd Battalion and later the 3rd. But as the unit marched into the city, shots rang, clearly fired from houses and from among the crowds. The soldiers returned fire and skirmishes broke out all across the city, with fire bombs being the main weapon of the insurrectionists. The fight lasted all day, with only the arrival of the other battalion finally putting an end to the chaos. Noticeable again was the clear targeting of the Parachute Regiment as with the attacks before.\n\nIn the end, 21 civilians laid dead, along with 4 guerrillas and one private of the Regiment.

To quickly pull the targeted units out, their weapons and most equipment was left with other British units and the People's Patrols and the five ferries were loaded with soldiers.\n\nOnce the ships left the harbour, four of the five went up in flames, set a-blaze by time-bombs hidden inside crates of pickled herring and lard. With the locals blocking the firemen or sabotaging the fire boats, the fire destroyed three ships completely, leaving only one to return to harbour as a smoldering husk. The fifth ship managed to make it to Dover, after frantic search revealed a busted-up timer on the bomb.\n\nIn total basically three battalions were wiped out, leaving a fourth at 2/3 strength.

 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war.

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense.

Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."

The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."

 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."

It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"

 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state.

 stability.21.desc.a:0 "A new report by the War Office shows a marked reduction in available manpower. It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepancy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
 stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause. Reports of mothers forbidding their children from answering the draft order are everywhere, and the War Office has submitted a report claiming that they are no longer sure how many people they are supposed to draft, as their bureaucracy has started to break down under the strain of processing all those missing soldiers."

 stability.22.desc.a:0 "Production in several factories has slowed down dramatically over the last few days as the workers have declared a strike on all war production. Demanding "Peace and Bread!", they have so far refused all attempts to negotiate a settlement. Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever. On the contrary, strikes have been reported in further factories, and the last few hold outs in the originally affected work sites have also put down their tools after facing the anger of their colleagues. While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to front line supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."
 stability.22.desc.c:0 "What started as industrial action in a few isolated places has now spread across the entire country, affecting even industries that are only connected to the war effort in tertiary ways. Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers. \n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

Decisive action is needed."

It took several hours until the police gained full control over the situation.\n\nAn ugly mood has settled over the capital as the barricades are cleared away and the dead are buried.

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind. Recruitment stations across the country report that a growing number of people have come by to ask what exactly the consequences would be if a "friend" of theirs who had attempted to avoid the draft would turn themselves in."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilized their extensive support networks to protest this decision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work.

Claiming to be from a soldier who at first tried to avoid the draft, but then realized that he must fight to save his country, it has apparently struck a nerve with many others who felt similarly.

 strikes_event.7.desc:0 "The troops assembled outside the towns overnight, maintaining noise and light discipline to keep the element of surprise. As the sun crept over the horizon and the workers manning the barricades at the factories looked forward to relief by the day shift, the assault columns moved in. The tired workers were sluggish to organize the resistance and quickly overcome. Leaving a small detachment to guard the prisoners, the troops sweept the town, arresting everyone on the list of known factory workers. By noon, the military had taken full control of the cities and instituted a curfew. No further resistence is expected. The majority of workers will soon be released on the condition that they return to work, the ring leaders will be held and put on trial. Death sentences are expected to be handed down."

 strikes_event.8.desc:0 "The troops assembled outside the towns overnight, but poor light and noise discipline gave the surprise away. As the troops moved in, they found the workers alert and ready for them. The first assault broke down in hails of thrown stones. A second assault with fixed bayonets was repulsed in brutal hand-to-hand fighting, leaving dozens of dead and dying in the streets.\n\nThe officers in charge have pulled back to consolidate their forces, while the workers are extending their fortifications and arming themselves with the weapons left behind in the retreat. A second day of fighting is expected tommorrow, but Military High Command does no longer believe that victory is likely."

 strikes_event.9.desc:0 "With tensions running high across the capital, [Root.GetLeader] announced a new law to protect the rights of workers even in times of war. The sweeping legislation mandates paid sick leave without limits, mandatory accident insurance for every worker, the right to join any union as well as, for the first time, the right for any employed women to have maternity leave after the birth of a child.\n\nWhile many in the government consider this nothing less than a complete surrender to the strikers, the results are conclusive: work has resumed in all factories."

 mutiny_event.1.desc:0 "After a few hours of tense negotiations at barracks gates and in front line dugouts, the mutiny in our army is over. Faced with the prospect of a fight they could not win, the mutineers quickly decided to stand down. \n\nThe primary issue then became the fate of those that had refused orders. Military High Command has opted for clemency and assured the mutineers that they would not be punished harshly. A few examples have been made in which some soldiers were demoted to a lower rank and transferred to a different unit."

 mutiny_event.2.t:0 "An empty threat"
 mutiny_event.2.desc:0 "Attempts to scare the mutineers into submission have backfired spectacularly as the troops showed little fear of the units sent to supress them. Using skills honed on the front lines, they quickly organized a defense of their positions that would make any attempt to defeat them very costly. \n\nThe officers in charge of the loyalist units have pulled back and are awaiting further orders, but this small success has no doubt strengthened the mutineers' resolve."

Fate has decided that we must be at war, to protect our freedom, our homes, our [Root.GetAdjective] way of life! We did not choose this war, it was forced on us! You know that I would not ask anything of you that I would not be willing to do myself, and I know that you will do whatever is necessary to secure victory."\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech in front of the troops appears to have had the desired effect, as the soldiers broke out in spontaneous cheers and returned to their duties without more than the usual amount of complaining."

Most soldiers decided not to take up arms against their own countrymen and surrendered peacefully. \n\nThe ringleaders will be tried in secret court martials, but the average soldier will be sent back to the front, albeit in a different unit to prevent mutineers from forming new cells."
