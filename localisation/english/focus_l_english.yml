 GER_african_allies:0 "African Allies"
 GER_african_allies_desc:0 "The first steps have been taken, now our true intension will be pushed for. Those natives can't control their resources efficiently anyway.

 GER_indian_crownjewel:0 "Piece of the Crown Jewel"
 GER_indian_crownjewel_desc:0 "India has a history longer than any other country. Uncountable empires amassed riches in its lands.

 GER_reform_election_system:0 "Reform the Electoral System"
 GER_reform_election_system_desc:0 "The current electoral system is still a holdout from the 1848 revolution, allowing the states to set their own, often contradictory, guidelines and rules.

 GER_reinforce_kiel_accords:0 "Reinforce the Kiel Accord"
 GER_reinforce_kiel_accords_desc:0 "The Kiel Accords have been a cornerstone for our continental foreign politics. Although a powerful alliance, it is held up mostly by our might. We need to make sure our friends won't fall behind us too much."

 GER_help_sweden:0 "Help Sweden"
 GER_help_sweden_desc:0 "Sweden has been born from the breakup of the United Kingdom in 1914 and ever since has been our closest Scandinavian Ally. Today it faces the treat of communism right across its border. We can't allow them to fall to this vile ideology."
 GER_reallign_finland:0 "Realign Finland"
 GER_reallign_finland_desc:0 "Finland became free at the start of the Russian Revolution, with the promise to join up with whoever wins this bloody affair. Yet we see them as an important ally in North Europa, if they can broke away from this ridiculous idea of a unified Russian Empire."

 GER_fulfill_pan_germanic_dream_desc:0 "Austria has been a close ally since their own revolution in 1848, but have chosen to stay out of the Kiel Accords. With the state of the world today, they can't effort this stance anymore. We will formerly invite them to our alliance and even float around the idea of a unified Pan-Germanic Union, if they are so inclined."
 GER_end_pseudo_democracy:0 "End that Pseudo Democracy"
 GER_end_pseudo_democracy_desc:0 "The French might have kick-started the revolutions in 1848, but have since seemingly abandoned the ideas of democracy and gone with Bonapartism, having elected a Bonaparte ever since their revolution.

 GER_bruening_election_desc:0 "Heinrich Brüning and the Catholic Zentrum party has won the election. This win radically shifted the political landscape from a liberal, protestant outlook, into a far more conservative, catholic one. Only time will tell, what new path Germania will take."
 GER_promise_east_prussia:0 "Promise of East Prussia"
 GER_promise_east_prussia_desc:0 "East Prussia was once given to the Russian Empire in exchange for peace and a recognition of the German Empire. Since then, the Russian Revolution has driven our people into the hands of the Poles, a nation unfit to rule such lands. The government in Warsaw has made it clear, that a peaceful solution is highly unlikely."
 GER_bridgehead:0 "Eastern Bridgehead"

 GER_east_prussian_war_desc:0 "All diplomatic channels have been exhausted, all possibilities for a peaceful return of our lost territories seem dead.

 GER_use_alldeutsch:0 "The Alldeutscher Verband offers support"
 GER_use_alldeutsch_desc:0 "The operation has been successful, yet the resistance remains far higher than expected. In the decades of Russian and Polish rule, the demographic makeup has shifted significantly, unfortunately not in our favor. Heinrich Claß and his infamous Pan-German League have offered their money, expertise and people to quickly empower Germans and fully integrate the East into the Republic."
 GER_integrate_konigsberg:0 "Restore Königsberg University"
 GER_integrate_konigsberg_desc:0 "The university of Königsberg was once the home to the greatest German minds of the 18th century and the home of the enlightenment. It has fallen into Polish hands, but with some new academics and a new rector, the university can again serve a German state."
 GER_special_elections:0 "Prepare for Special Election"
 GER_special_elections_desc:0 "The Pan-German League has worked its magic and brought the eastern territories firmly back into our hand. They were indeed so successful, that those stories about forced relocation and public violence had to be fabricated by their political enemies. Anyway, with such an influx of Germans for the ballot boxes, our recent election can't possibly, fairly represent the will of all Germans. Another one is needed."
 GER_break_up_f:0 "National Might"
 GER_break_up_f_desc:0 "As the German Empire fell and the Frankfurt Republic rose, Germans lost their national pride and focus. For too long, bought politicians dictated from ivory towers and far away parliaments, over the lifes of ordinary people.

 GER_finish_rhi_f:0 "Retake the Rhineland"
 GER_finish_rhi_f_desc:0 "As the southern communist traitor broke away from the weak republic, the Rhineland did the same, but staying out of the fighting. Now the time has come to take back the industrial heartlands of our glorious Empire."

 GER_austrian_exchange:0 "Austrian Question"
 GER_austrian_exchange_desc:0 "The lands of the Habsburg Empire have been recovered as good as possible, yet the question remains what to do with the Heart of the Dynasty. The Austrian lands are held by us, the Royals asking for it daily. We might be able to strike a deal."
 GER_protect_balticsea:0 "Ensure Access to the Baltic Sea"
 GER_protect_balticsea_desc:0 "Two seas are the main trading routes for our Empire, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The eastern sea is in danger of the Danish closing the Danish Belts for us. We have to act quickly, before they can even thing about something like that."

 GER_break_up_c:0 "Collective Might"
 GER_break_up_c_desc:0 "As liberal and progressive some of the aspects of the Frankfurt Republic seemed, all of it was under the supervision and guidance of capital. But now, spurred on by the ridiculous 'Special Election', the workers have finally broken free from the chains that held them back. Now the time for revolution has come and the German workers will carry it to the end."
 GER_finish_rhi_c:0 "Free the Rhinish Workers"
 GER_finish_rhi_c_desc:0 "The Rhineland holds the greatest concentration of Workers anywhere in Germany, but were stopped by the old orders from joining our revolution.

 GER_free_colonies:0 "Support Native Movements"
 GER_free_colonies_desc:0 "Germany has had colonies for a long time, fueling its economy with the labor of native slaves. These sins have benefited us, but we saw the error of our ways. The French colonial empire on the other hand, still holds incredibly strong and still exploits the natives under its thumb. We have the moral obligation to fund and support resistance groups, helping them to overthrow their oppressors."
 GER_dutch_workers:0 "Spread the Revolution Westward"
 GER_dutch_workers_desc:0 "The dutch have had their own history of labor movements and revolution attempts, all stomped out, often with the help of the Frankfurt Republic.

 GER_finish_revolution:0 "Finish the Revolution"
 GER_finish_revolution_desc:0 "The revolution of 1789 changed Europe and the World. Suddenly people became aware of the power the proletariat holds. But since then, France has never truly finished the revolution it started. The time has come to finish the revolution, that changed the world."
 GER_stay_alone:0 "Stay Alone"
 GER_stay_alone_desc:0 "The British Union has nothing to give us, what can't manage ourselves. The German path for class unity doesn't lie with an island, isolated from the continent. It lies with itself."
 GER_swiss_workers:0 "Spread the Revolution Southward"
 GER_swiss_workers_desc:0 "The swiss have seen revolutions and civil war, but without a clear understanding for class struggle or workers' liberation. We should help them see those errors and fund a socialist opposition, willing to fight with us, if necessary."
 GER_supp_roman_rep:0 "Expedition of the Thousand"
 GER_supp_roman_rep_desc:0 "The Roman Republic, birthed back in 1849, has taken the path for a communist boot, as it was once attempted by Garibaldi. Now the chances are better than ever. With our workers and soldiers backing them, nothing will stand in the way of a Red Italy."
 GER_false_prophet:0 "Slay the False Prophet"
 GER_false_prophet_desc:0 "The British Union has shown time and time again that they ideologically settled long ago, unwilling or unable to finish the Revolution. If the Home of the Revolution can't fulfill the promises to its workers, we shall or die trying."

 FRA_mex_arms:0 "Arms for Soldiers Scheme"
 FRA_mex_arms_desc:0 "A deal was struck between the Mexican government and ours. France keeps industrializing the arms industry in Mexico and Mexico 'encourages' its men to volunteer for the Foreign Legion and serve in the French Army.

 FRA_lease_baja:0 "Lease of Baja California"
